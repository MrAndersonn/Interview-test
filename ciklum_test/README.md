# Ciklum test
My project have a few module with test in each other.

### 1st Task (Sum of Numbers in N)
The first task is located in **sumOfNumber** module. In class Main have simple function that can
calculate sum of number;

### 2nd Task (Refactoring)
I located the sorce of this task in folder **refactoring**. Have some idea with AddressBook reaslisation,
but realisation of this class depend of business logic of this class.
```
I did such changes based on the fact that extraction of data from the DB can cost a lot of time
and the user should not expect each time when trying to get a list
```
### 3rd Task (Logic)
I was write two algorithm for realization of this task. Two solution locate in **logic** module(logic/src)
#### Loop solution
```

I find this implementation more optimized, it has a linear convergence and does not use any additional resources.
```
#### Recurcive solution
```
This solution is not entirely optimized for large-size lines,
because the array is passed to a function by value and therefore there is a copy of the data.
```
### 4th Task (game)
All sources locate in **game** module, in model package. This package have main function, that i was using as test for
my function(replace, execute, etc...)


## Thank you for attention!
